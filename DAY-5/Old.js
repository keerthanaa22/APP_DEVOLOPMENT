          Apple Watch is a wearable smartwatch that allows users to accomplish a variety of tasks,
           including making phone calls, sending text messages and reading email. Apple released 
           the Apple Watch on April 24, 2015.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
          Apple initially designed the watch to replace phones and reduce the time users 
          spend looking at phone screens. However, the Apple Watch became popular in part 
          for its innovations in fitness tracking and health monitoring, as well as its 
          ability to be used with internet of things (IoT) devices.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
          Since its release, the Apple Watch has added several new features, 
          including water resistance, blood oxygen and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
          readings, a body temperature sensor and an emergency SOS that can detect 
          when a user falls or has some other accident and contact emergency services.
           The watches can be synced with a user's iPhone, Mac laptop and AirPods. 
           Apple Watches accounted for 43% of smartwatch shipments in the fourth 
           quarter of 2022, dominating that market, according to research firm Counterpoint.
